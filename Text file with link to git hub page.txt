Notes:had issues with getting thenginx container to run

"unknown directive "client" in /etc/nginx/conf.d/headers.conf:7
nginx: [emerg] unknown directive "client" in /etc/nginx/conf.d/headers.conf:7
"
referencing this line "client_max_body_size 10M;" in headers.conf file

This may have to do with Amazon linux 2 instance not being able to install
certbot the same way as shown in lab 6 step 4.All other containers run fine
without issues.
